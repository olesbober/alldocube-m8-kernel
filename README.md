# Alldocube M8 Kernel Modification

This is the repository that contains my work at attempting to modify the kernel of the Alldocube M8 Android device to allow OTG charging. Here I will list:

* Any links that will help me complete this project easier.
* Any references to other people's work that I used.
* Other stuff, that will likely come up as I work on this.

Please note, I am new to any sort of Android development, so this may take me a while! I am mainly doing this for the learning experience.
